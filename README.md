## Barcoded (*working on the name)
Barcoded  is an app that helps store barcodes, qr codes, and many other types of representing data in images. as I have little to no experience with xcode and swiftui, this was a large challenge for me, but I learned a lot, and I am almost ready to publish it to testflight.
